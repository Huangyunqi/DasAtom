# Results version explanation

## For old_ver_0814:

That results are wrong for paralleled gates searching. We will fix the bug for the next version. To save the running time, we will use the existing embeddings and partitions to run the program. In this case, the running time will not be the actual time. Remember to use the time in this version for the final since searching the paralleled gates only used less time.
